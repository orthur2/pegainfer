# Qwen3.5-4B serving: openinfer vs vLLM on RTX 5090

**Created**: 2026-06-15

**Updated**: 2026-06

**TL;DR**: This Qwen3.5 decode-tuning refresh improves openinfer's direct TPOT
by `2.1-3.2%`. HTTP decode is close on 1-token prompts, but vLLM 0.23.0 still
leads 1024/256 TPOT and high-concurrency output throughput. TTFT rows are
fixed-client timings because the longer prompts report different token totals.

## HTTP Concurrency Sweep

Workload: 1024 input / 256 output, `num_prompts=64`, random fixed-length
client probes, prefix cache disabled on both servers.

## Attribution

OpenInfer's measured in-process 1024/256 concurrency-16 run reported `9.320 ms`
steady TPOT avg, while the HTTP row is `15.566 ms`. Nsight Systems therefore
points the high-concurrency gap at serving/scheduler/event-sync overhead before
another model-kernel rewrite. The full HTTP trace includes startup and warmup,
so it is coarse attribution only.

## Caveats

- This is a same-host synthetic benchmark, not a production traffic trace.
- The 1-token-prompt decode rows have equal reported input/output token totals.
  The 1024/256 and 2048/1 rows do not, so TTFT is a fixed-client workload
  timing rather than token-normalized prefill throughput.
- Prefix cache was disabled on both servers for this refresh.
- vLLM startup was made serviceable on this host by disabling the FlashInfer
  sampler path. The measured decode was greedy (`temperature=0`); attention
  still selected FlashAttention 2.
- Nsight Systems direct traces are measured-range. HTTP traces are full-process
  diagnostics and should be treated as coarse attribution only.
- The current honest claim is narrower than vLLM parity: this branch improves
  openinfer Qwen3.5 decode TPOT by a few percent, closes most of the prompt-len
  1 HTTP decode gap, and leaves the 1024/256 plus high-concurrency HTTP gap as
  follow-up work.
