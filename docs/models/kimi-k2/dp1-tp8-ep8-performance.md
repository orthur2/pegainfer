## Target

| Item | Target / baseline |
| --- | --- |
| Machine | `h20-100`, 8× NVIDIA H20 |
| Model | `/data/models/Kimi-K2.5` |
| Shape | DP1 TP8 EP8 |
| Primary workload | `input_len=1`, `output_len=128`, `ignore-eos`, `bs=64` |
| vLLM baseline | TP1 DP8 EP8, `vllm bench serve`, output `583.9 tok/s`, TPOT median `109.00ms`, TPOT p99 `109.76ms` |
| PegaInfer goal | output tok/s `> 583.9` at bs64, while preserving token correctness |

The comparison target comes from [vllm-h20-baseline.md](vllm-h20-baseline.md).
The correctness ground truth starts from
[pplx-ep-correctness.md](pplx-ep-correctness.md): TP8 PPLX must be token-trace
exact against TP8 NCCL under the same bs64 active-decode schedule.

## Gate Rules

Every kept optimization needs all of these recorded before commit:

| Gate | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Profile | Start from an observed profile or benchmark delta. Record the command, output path, and the measured bottleneck or symptom. |
| Motivation / expected gain | State why the change should help and the expected size/direction of the win before implementing it. |
| Microbench | Add or run the smallest probe that isolates the changed subsystem when practical. If no microbench is practical, record why and use the closest lower-level measurement. |
| Correctness | Record the exact command, output file, token hash, and comparison target. For TP8/PPLX changes, compare against the TP8 NCCL baseline unless a stronger reference is documented. |
| Performance | Record bs64 service numbers and the lower-level in-process probe that explains the delta. |
| Scope | State whether the optimization targets frontend/scheduler, CUDA graph, collectives, MLA, MoE, or sampling. |
| Revert line | Record the measurable regression that would make the change revert-worthy. |
| Commit | Commit the code and this doc update together. |

No optimization is accepted on performance numbers alone.

Preferred entry shape:

```text
Profile:
  <command + report path + bottleneck>
Motivation / expected gain:
  <why this change should move bs64, and by roughly how much>
Microbench:
  <isolated probe, or the reason a subsystem-only probe is not available>
Correctness gate:
  <hash / trace / reference path>
Performance gate:
  <bs64 service number + supporting in-process/profile number>
Decision:
  <keep/reject/defer + commit>
```

This is a discipline, not a rigid template. The important part is that future
readers can reconstruct why an optimization was attempted, what it was expected
to buy, and which evidence made it worth keeping.

## Canonical Bs64 Pressure Test

Use this exact service pressure-test shape for bs64 comparisons. This is the
single project-wide pressure command for Kimi-K2 bs64 reports. Do not change
prompt/output length, request count, request rate, concurrency, percentiles,
streaming mode, or `ignore-eos` when reporting numbers against the vLLM bs64
baseline.

### B1 Profile Notes

Profile:

```text
/tmp/kimi-bs64-baseline/pegainfer_tp8_pplx_bs64_d639e55.log
/tmp/kimi-bs64-baseline/pegainfer_tp8_pplx_bs64_d639e55.json
```

Observed:

- bs64 output throughput is `137.51 tok/s`, far below vLLM bs64 `583.9 tok/s`.
- TPOT p50 is `26.40ms`, much lower than vLLM bs64 TPOT p50 `109.00ms`.
- TTFT p50 is `54.76s`, showing requests are queued in long waves.
- Current TP8 scheduler cap is still `KIMI_RUNNER_MAX_BATCH = 4`, so bs64 service
  pressure effectively runs as repeated 4-row decode waves.

Motivation / expected gain:

Raising the DP1 TP8 admission/arena path beyond 4 rows should attack the main
service-throughput gap directly. If per-token TPOT stayed near the B1 value,
bs64 throughput would have roughly 4x headroom before kernel scaling becomes the
dominant limit. The actual gain must be measured because MLA/MoE kernels,
collectives, scratch size, and graph capture may scale nonlinearly with batch.

Microbench:

B1 is a service profile, not an optimization. The next optimization must add a
lower-level probe for the changed layer, for example an in-process bs sweep or a
decode arena/scheduler trace that confirms active rows > 4 before rerunning the
canonical bs64 pressure command.

### O1 Lazy Bucketed Bs64 Decode Arenas

Profile:

```text
/tmp/kimi-bs64-baseline/pegainfer_tp8_pplx_bs64_d639e55.log
/tmp/kimi-bs64-baseline/pegainfer_tp8_pplx_bs64_d639e55.json
```

Observed:

- Canonical bs64 service throughput was only `137.51 tok/s`, with TTFT p50
  `54.76s`.
- TPOT p50 was `26.40ms`, which was good for each 4-row wave but did not
  translate into bs64 service throughput.
- Code profile: TP8 scheduler admitted at most `KIMI_RUNNER_MAX_BATCH = 4`,
  and worker startup allocated all decode arenas eagerly up to the worker cap.

Motivation / expected gain:

Raising the scheduler and worker cap to 64 removes the obvious admission limit.
Decode arenas are allocated lazily in power-of-two buckets so canonical bs64
uses one bs64 KV/scratch/graph arena without allocating every size from 1 to 64.
The rank preflight makes allocation failure happen before prefill/decode
collectives, avoiding a partial-rank failure mode. Expected direction: much
lower bs64 TTFT and enough active rows to expose the real bs64 kernel and PPLX
communication cost.

Microbench:

```bash
cd /root/develop/xingming/pegainfer
CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda \
NVCC=/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc \
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/pegainfer-nccl-lib:/usr/local/cuda/lib64:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:-} \
PEGAINFER_CUDA_SM=90a \

cargo run --release -p pegainfer-server --features kimi-k2-pplx-ep --bin bench_serving -- \
  --model-path /data/models/Kimi-K2.5 \
  --cuda-graph true \
  --format json \
  --out /tmp/kimi_pplx_tp8_o1_bucket_micro_bs64.json \
  request --prompt-len 1 --output-len 128 --concurrency 64 --warmup 0 --iters 1
```

Result:

- Output path: `/tmp/kimi_pplx_tp8_o1_bucket_micro_bs64.json`.
- Workload confirmed `concurrency=64`, `output_len=128`, all `64` traces had
  length `128`.
- In-process wall throughput, computed as `64 * 128 / max_e2e`, was about
  `226.9 tok/s` (`max_e2e=36.108s`).
- Steady TPOT p50/p95/p99 was `178.35/201.96/218.85ms`.

Correctness gate:

```bash
cd /root/develop/xingming/pegainfer
CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda \
NVCC=/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc \
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/pegainfer-nccl-lib:/usr/local/cuda/lib64:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:-} \

  --cuda-graph false \
  --format json \
  --out /tmp/kimi_pplx_tp8_correctness64_o1_bucket.json \
  request --output-len 64 --warmup 0 --iters 1
```

Result: generated-token hash `4920f088c2338236`, matching the TP8 NCCL/PPLX
baseline.

Performance gate:

Canonical bs64 service result:

```text
/tmp/kimi-bs64-baseline/pegainfer_tp8_pplx_bs64_o1-bucket-07d6a40.log
/tmp/kimi-bs64-baseline/pegainfer_tp8_pplx_bs64_o1-bucket-07d6a40.json
```

Observed:

- Successful requests: `256/256`.
- Output throughput: `145.18 tok/s` vs B1 `137.51 tok/s`.
- Peak output throughput: `504.00 tok/s` vs B1 `168.00 tok/s`.
- TTFT p50/p95/p99: `31.00/35.23/35.76s` vs B1 p50/p99
  `54.76/58.68s`.
- TPOT p50/p95/p99: `195.07/221.08/224.72ms`.

Decision:

Keep. O1 preserves token correctness and turns bs64 into real 64-row decode
waves, but the service output throughput is still far below the vLLM `583.9
tok/s` target. The next accepted optimization needs a profile of the bs64
decode step itself, especially PPLX MoE routing/combine, MLA decode, and TP
collectives.

/tmp/kimi-bs64-baseline/pegainfer_tp8_pplx_bs64_00b3f1f.json
```

Observed:

- Canonical bs64 service result at `00b3f1f`: `256/256` success, output
  throughput `353.91 tok/s`, request throughput `2.76 req/s`.
- TTFT p50/p95/p99: `4.58/9.04/10.24s`.
- TPOT p50/p95/p99: `146.15/172.83/175.10ms`.
- ITL p50/p95/p99: `116.62/119.65/122.74ms`.
- Peak output-token bucket from vLLM bench result:
  `max_output_tokens_per_s=640.0`.

Microbench:

```bash
cd /root/develop/xingming/pegainfer
CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda \
NVCC=/usr/local/cuda/bin/nvcc \
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/pegainfer-nccl-lib:/usr/local/cuda/lib64:${LD_LIBRARY_PATH:-} \

  --cuda-graph true \

  --out /tmp/kimi_pplx_tp8_00b3f1f_micro_bs64_o128_warm1.json \
  request --prompt-len 1 --output-len 128 --concurrency 64 --warmup 1 --iters 1
```

Result:

- Output path:
  `/tmp/kimi_pplx_tp8_00b3f1f_micro_bs64_o128_warm1.json`.
- All `64` traces have length `128`.
- Hash counter: `32x 82a791616c737442`, `16x 4ae8834e96c7d195`,
  `16x 24b2b3856ac0ea3a`.
- Steady TPOT p50/p95/p99: `107.76/109.06/110.45ms`, equivalent to about
  `593.9 tok/s` for a 64-row decode step.
- End-to-end p50/max: `20.81/20.81s`, equivalent to about `393.6 tok/s`
  over `64 * 128` output tokens.

Motivation / expected gain:

The steady decode step is already in the vLLM target range, while request e2e is
not. `bench_serving` measures `first_decode_step_ms` as the interval from the
first emitted token to the second emitted token; it is not the first kernel
duration. Code inspection shows the Kimi scheduler coalesces 64 requests, then
runs `prefill_request` one slot at a time before entering batched decode. The
observed wall time is consistent with:

```text
64 serial prompt_len=1 first-token forwards + 127 batched decode steps
```

An accepted fix needs to make the first-token path batched while preserving the
C1 TP8 NCCL token trace. Replacing prompt prefill with decode is not sufficient;
see the rejected item below.

## Candidate Queue

| Priority | Area | Hypothesis | Correctness risk |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| P0 | scheduler / prefill | Implement an exact batched `prompt_len=1` first-token path instead of 64 serial `prefill_request` calls. It must preserve the C1 TP8 NCCL token trace, unlike the rejected decode-substitution probe. | High: first-token KV state affects all following tokens. |
| P0 | PPLX / MoE | O1 shows real bs64 waves but TPOT p50 is `195.07ms`; routed expert dispatch/combine or Marlin route capacity may now dominate. | High: routed expert and combine weights are correctness-sensitive. |
| P0 | CUDA Graph | Reduce bs64 first-step graph capture/replay and metadata overhead after kernel profile identifies host or graph-node cost. | Medium: graph replay must preserve per-row metadata and PPLX participation. |
| P1 | frontend | Measure HTTP/streaming overhead separately from in-process TPOT. | Low for model math, medium for serving semantics. |
| P1 | collectives | Profile TP all-reduce and routed combine tail at bs64. | Medium: BF16/F32 collective boundary is correctness-sensitive. |
| P2 | MLA/MoE | Retune batch-shape kernels only after scheduler and graph bottlenecks are visible. | High: routed expert and MLA cache layout are easy to perturb. |

## Rejected / Deferred

| Date | Idea | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-05-25 | Use TP1/DP8 correctness as the baseline for this doc | Deferred. TP1/DP8 matched short probes but diverged at 32 tokens, so DP1 TP8 work uses TP8 NCCL/PPLX baseline first. |
| 2026-05-25 | Use the batch decode kernel as the `prompt_len=1` first-token path | Rejected. New TP8 NCCL and PPLX matched each other (`/tmp/kimi_nccl_tp8_single_prefill_batch_o2_o5.json` vs `/tmp/kimi_pplx_tp8_single_prefill_batch_o2_o5.json`: 0 mismatches), but both changed `32/64` per-index traces compared with the C1 TP8 NCCL ground truth `/tmp/kimi_nccl_tp8_active64_o5_final.json`. Hash counter changed from `32x 7c4c5d83355198fd`, `32x 9eecc1ca6fb3409d` to `48x 9eecc1ca6fb3409d`, `16x f45b2f0248e7059d`; this is not correctness-preserving. |
