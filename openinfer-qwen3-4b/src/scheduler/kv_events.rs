//! Translate the engine's internal block lifecycle into the neutral
//! [`KvBlockEvent`] stream a cache-aware router consumes.
//!
//! Two sources feed one stream:
//! - **Store** comes from the seal site (rich u64 hashes straight off the token
//!   blocks), via [`Qwen3Executor::take_kv_store_events`](crate::executor).
//! - **Remove** comes from the block pool's eviction broadcast, which carries
//!   only the engine's 128-bit lineage hash — so each store also records a
//!   `lineage → sequence_hash` entry that the eviction is translated through.
//!
//! The router works in dynamo's u64 hash space; the lineage hash never leaves
//! this module.
